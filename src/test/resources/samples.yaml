    - "cure GBM"
  expected-output: |
    Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive form of brain cancer known for its resistance to conventional 
    therapies. Antibody-based research could potentially provide innovative treatments by targeting specific 
    pathways or markers associated with GBM.
    Would you like to select GBM as the disease to focus your antibody research on?
